# Assessment and Evaluation

Finding out the needs and the prior knowledge of the participants (assessment) and how the workshop met them (evaluation) are two important steps for improving the quality of the trainings, the trainng materials and the experience for participants (and facilitators). Allocate time and resources before, during and after a workshop to identify the needs of your audience and check how well they were met afterwards.

## Pre-Training Assessment

Pre-training assessments should fill the gaps of missing knowledge of the facilitators to being able to prepare the training as good as possible regarding the participants. This leads to better trainings and less problems during them, but still it should always be decided training by training, if the effort is worth it. This depends mostly on organizational parameters, like how much time in advance is left, and how good you already know your target audience.

Steps to do:
1. Create a registration form with email field
2. Think about, what are the uncertain variables regarding your participants? What do you want to know from them? => Ask yourself who they are.
2. Create survey
3. Send out link to the survey at least one week in advance
4. Evaluate the survey before the training
5. Implement outcomes of the evaluation to the training concept and content


The survey should answer questions like:
* Who is participating?
	* Profession
	* Skill levels: TDM, Programming, Research, (Newbie, advanced or expert)
	* Technical systems: OS, Software they use, etc.
* What is the prior knowledge regarding the content of the training?
* What do the participants expect (reagarding the communicated knowledge about the session in advance)?

It is also important to think about questions you want to re-validate after the workshop, so you can check progress in the skills of the particiapnts and confidence in applying them.

## Post-Training Evaluation

The survey after the training should evaluate the progress achived by the training, the satisfaction ot the participants with the training and further improvements.

Steps to do:
1. Set Up evaluation form
2. Send out email with link
3. Send out a reminder two weeks later to the ones still missing
4. Evaluate results
5. Implement outcomes into trainings materials, the training concepts and the strategy

For effective training and learning evaluation, the principal questions should be:

* To what extent were the identified training needs objectives achieved by the programme?
* To what extent were the learners' objectives achieved?
* What specifically did the learners learn or was useful to be reminded of?
* How was the prior expertise and how is the expertise in certain fields after the training (programming, legal issues, ContentMine project)?
* What commitment have the learners made about the learning they are going to implement on their return to work?
* What do they want to learn next (general in terms of Content-Mining)?
* What can be improved?
