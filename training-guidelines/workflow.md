# General workflow

This should give facilitators and organizers some orientation on which steps to perform when. The *days ahead* estimations roughly indicate when this process should start, since there are dependencies later on.

The major points can be raised as personal issues for the facilitators/organizers, with the subpoints as issue notes. This helps keeping track of progress. Also, each major point should be discussed directly between facilitators/organizers at least once.

1. Think/talk about what people want to learn, we have three major use cases (filtering literature, finding relevant facts in) (*weeks ahead*)
2. Identify knowledge gaps and uncertainties and create pre-training assessment. Creating and sending out a pre-training assessment is optional. (*weeks ahead*)
3. Set up repo via template [LINK]() (*28d ahead*)
	- fill in basic informations together with organizer: location, date, host, facilitators
4. Send out pre-training assessment (optional, *28d ahead*)
5. Remember participants to pre-training assessment (*18d ahead*)
6. Choose modules according to target audience after closing pre-training assessment. We have three module categories (*14d ahead*)
	- A: Introduction sessions
	- B: application of CMtools to do content mining
	- C: more hacky sessions, working together on user problems, downstream analysis
7. Draft session schedule (*14d ahead*)
  The session schedule should include short breaks after each session, and possibly time and space for a social event in the evening.
	- think about: framing, target audience, purpose for project and participants
	- discuss what should not / can not be done and why
	- potential technical issues -> prepare solution (additional documentation)
	- potential content questions / problems -> prepare answers
	- offer some social event in the evening
	- follow-ups
8. Update repo (*28d ahead*)
	- schedule
	- pre-requisites
	- downloads / installations / datasets / tech requirements
	- go through ["before workshop" checklist](checklist.md#before-the-workshop)
9. Prepare materials (*10d ahead*)
	- slides -> upload
	- tech -> VM / USBs
	- handouts / posters / flipchart workshop sheets
	- online stuff -> pad, repo
	- personal notes
10. Prepare follow up's
	- Set up post-training evaluation form (*5d ahead*)
	- Set up email for participants: post-training survey, follow ups
11. Do workshop
	-  go through ["during workshop" checklist](checklist.md#during-the-workshop)
	- prepare locality (beamer, seating arrangement, material for harvesting)
12. Send out email to participants (*0d later*) 
13. Document lessions learned by faciliators (*1d later* )
14. Write blog post (optional) (*3d later)
15. Get feedback from host (*3d later*)
16. update repo with content generated during workshop (*asap*)
