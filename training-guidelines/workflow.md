# General workflow

This should give facilitators and organizers some orientation on which steps to perform when. The **days ahead** estimations roughly indicate when this process should start, since there are dependencies later on.

The major points can be raised as personal issues for the facilitators/organizers, with the subpoints as issue notes. This helps keeping track of progress. Also, each major point should be discussed directly between facilitators/organizers at least once.
