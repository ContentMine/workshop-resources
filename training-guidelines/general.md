# General guidelines


## Atmosphere
* don't pressure yourself and the participants too much: trainings must be fun, interesting and social
* have a good balance between easy going hands on session, social interactive sessions and theoretical talks.
* when you do something on the screen, take it easy and make intentional breaks to let new users follow up.
* ask if people are hold back by others things out of their control to implement things learned
* Is there anywhere pressure in the timeline? Keep spaces free to relax for everyone. People should never think “I need a break!”.
* Make everyone happy: Hosts, participants and you, the facilitator!
* create an inclusive and diverse feeling: no racism, no sexism, etc. 
* be clear about problems, limitations and advantages, but always offer a solution


## Narrative

Questions to answer:
* Who is the audience?
* What do the visitors expect (reagarding the communicated knowledge about the session in advance)?
* What do the hosts expect?
* What is the problem?
* Why does the workshop help to solve the problem?
* What are the crucial transformation events from one session to the next? 
* How do we manage them? How do we transfer the activity?

prepare text snippets:
* what is a fact?
* what is content mining?
* what is content mine?
* what is content mine good for?
* what is content mining good for?
* what does it have to do with the TDM exception?


## Workflow

* seperate questions and tasks in different time phases: 
  * conceptualizing
  * planning
  * executing
  * evaluating
* create a checklist for things which needs to be done (and when)
* check previous trainings: documents, PR work, lessons learned
* check the cumulative lessons learned document


## Content

* Slides: offer some advice, how and when to create slides
* Presentations: offer basic advice how to present well
* training structure: offer some examples of slots in a workshop in general and for CM in specific. Which formats are available?
how do facilitators organize their activites during the training? notes, laptop docs??
* narrative: offer information how to create a strong and compelling narrative in your training. this is a very crucial point


## Methods

* Let participants group up (2-3-4), target: 4-6 groups
* diversity in used formats: interaction, hacking, talk
* evaluation: how to make your evaluation
* offer participants ways to get to the necessary level in advance: install sw, learn stuff, read things


## Limitations

* are you allowed to share your data with others?
* are people excluded from some acitivies? e.g. non-devs
* Do we assume anywhere pre-knowledge? Is the content to difficult?

## Dealing with problems

* offer advice for offline alternatives: AoH, prepare always something!
* offer hints for testing the software, the data and the slides for readiness
Social interaction: offer some basic methods and concrete examples for social interactions. Give hints for common problems (people not interested, people start to fight, people blame you for failing/weak training, etc.)
* Which informations need to be available all the time, especially for new arriving people?
* think through if way more or less people arrive: will the sessions still work? what could help, what do you have to change?
* how to treat racism, sexism, etc. Think about this when inviting people in advance and put focus on this 
* work out alternative strategies for 3 and for 50 persons


# Lessons learned

This list describes common problems that may occur and how they can be solved.

| PROBLEMS | LESSONS LEARNED |
| The central message (vertical integration, ease of access and scalability, sectioning of papers, use of supplementary information) does not come across. | Put focus on unique points of interaction (sHTML, ctree, results) and not the technical details. |
| The use case demonstrated is not really appropriate for audience. | Start with powerful demo first, then go into technical details |
| Too much content in too less time, not enough time for teaching/delivering key message | Start low but have more in-depth stuff available. |
| Missing narrative, difficult transitions between sessions | Change preparation time allocation from 80% tech/ 20% storyline to 50/50. |
| Early technological problems (keyboard locales, VM on windows) lose large parts of the group, and it is difficult to recover from there. | Have backup plans and material: reserve more time for error handling and if something does not work. Define alternative tasks while solving problems. |
| Getting started with the VM could be problematic especially for newcomers. | People should not have to worry about CLI other than copying the relevant commands. Everything should have been within one folder which would be the starting folder of the command line. |
| Missing central documentation to direct people to. | Prepare a github repo and an etherpad. |
| Long URLs are difficult to type. | When uris are used, use bit.ly |
| People start wandering off on their own e.g. when some are still stuck at installing, and others already completed the task. | Define clearer “group stages” (Now we’re installing for 5 min; then we’ll begin with notebook; play around with facts for X min; then talk about results) |
| When a session loses focus, it is difficult to catch people's attention again and pull them back together. | Try to provide "a social solution for a technical problem" - clear statements what to do if something fails; have people group up in teams of two with different OS and experience level, so that they move more together. |
