This document should help you to work out the training materials, work out a proper training concept and execute it on spot. Additionally you should use the [checklist.md](LINK), which supports you through this process.

This document works together with [checklist.md](LINNK). In this document you get practical support how to work out a training concept, and what to do in the main steps toward it. The checklist.md](LINK) is an easy to use list to check, if you have done the most important steps, which are described in this document in more detail.

## 1. Goals and Strategy

A training can be quite easy if you know exactly what you want to do and what your goal is. But that's not a generic thing, so you have to think about for every training, for every host, for every group of participants from the beginning. And also don't underestimate the possibilities to improve your training skills so far. 

The first goal is to identify the goal(s) and work out a proper strategy to reach them with the training. This here is the smallest section in the guideline, but when you pay too less time for this, the outcome will most likely not satisfy you and a lot of time can be spend into the wrong direction.

So take yourself some time and think in depth about the following points:
* Who is your target audience? Think in detail: age, expertise, prior-knowledge, expectations, diversity, etc.
* What should be the concrete outcome for the participants, for the hosts and for ContentMine?
* What is needed to achieve the outcomes?
* What is the problem you want to solve with the things you teach?
* What does the host expect?

**Think especially about a strong narrative and a strong use-case you want to offer the participants.**

Prepare short, concise answer for these questions:
* What is a fact?
* What is content mining?
* What is content mine?
* What is content mining good for?
* What is ContentMine good for?
* What does it have to do with the TDM exception?

And to sum it up: **Make everyone happy: Hosts, participants and you, the facilitator!**

## 2. Work out the Training

### Workflow
* plan with time to change the room setup
* think about participants coming later in: how to include them most easily, how often will this happen?
* use the [¢hecklist.md](LINK) and add your specific tasks with time to it.
* check previous trainings: github repository, documents, follow ups, lessons learned
* work in groups as often as possible. peer learning is a great way to have fun and learn something
* check if people are excluded from some acitivies? e.g. non-devs, people without laptop, etc.
* prepare offline alternatives, WIFI always can fail.
* Have a good balance between hands on sessions, social interactive sessions and theoretical talks.
* Check if there is anywhere pressure in the timeline when planning and after finishing the timeline. Keep spaces free to relax for everyone. People should never think “I need a break!”.
* Identify the central transformational events from one block to the next and think about what is necessary for it. e.g. from presentation to hack session, or from world cafe group to the big circle
* think about transition from last session and into next session

### Culture
* create an inclusive and diverse space: no racism, no sexism, etc.
* have fun
* be positive
* help people
* don't blame them for not knowing something!
* be patient

### Content
* be clear about problems, limitations and advantages, but always offer a solution
* Is there some pre-knowledge assumed? 
* Is the content to difficult?
* do you use too many technical terms?
* don't overload participants with too much information

### Session Formats

Here we offer you some common types of sessions which can be used to put them together to a full training schedule
* always sum up after blocks of content, what you did and why

#### Introduction
* tell your name and your background: why are you interested in Content-Mining?
* tell about ContentMine: website, the idea, Shuttleworth Fellowship, Peter Murray Rust, Team, 
* use established narratives [narratives.md](LINK)
* give an overview of what will happen in the training
* tell what problem we want to solve and why CM is important
* short introduction round: why are they here, name, activities/profession

#### Presentation
This is a list of basic information how to present well. If you look for How to create slides, please go down to "Create Training Materials" > "Slides"
* ask questions to the audience: have they heard of it? etc.
* tell a strong story
* ask yourself: what is the purpose of the talk? 
* breath out before you start and take a 2-3 seconds break 
* stand still with your feet, imagine your feet are growing into the floor like the roots of a tree to have a stable stand
* relax and try to find something positive/funny about the presentation when you are nervous

#### Hack Session
A Hack Session is when the participants together with the faciliators try to hack on their own laptops in an open framing. This can be small ones from 5-15 minutes, but also longer ones over a hour. The guide offers some basic support, but a lot depend on what software, which use-case and which data you use. The sessions can be done individually, but most likely they are better done in groups of 2-3 persons.

Hack Sessions can be combined easily with On-Screen sessions. After the introduction on the screen, people can hack on a sandbox or a small worked-out task by themselves in the open.

Hack Session are best for around 10 up to 20 participants with 2 faciliators. Then for every additional 10 participants another facilitator is necessary/helpful.

**Purpose**


* let people do something by themselves 
* let everyone create individual results if possible
* let them learn in groups
* guide them to something helpfull for their own interests
* learning by doing
* show them the power and magic of content mining in real

**Preparations**


* work out tasks for the participants
	* small tasks of 10 minutes are often better than one hour slots of one big project. maybe chunk down your big slot to 4 smaller chunks
		* find information xyz
		* we have x, we want z, please do y
	* tell them the timeslot and the goal they should achive
* Prepare an offline alternative

**Timeline**
* explain the session: what is the goal, what do they have to do for it, why is this of interest to them, when will it end
	* show a demo (optional): sometimes it can be helpful to offer some concrete ideas
	* ask if every group has a laptop, the data and if the software is running
	* ask advanced participants to help after they managed
	* ask if everything is clear
* start hacking session
* walk around: talk and help people
* inform 5min before session ends
* end hacking session
* let the people present/tell their results and interpretation. this is where the real magic happens and the own thoughts get connected with others.
	* what have you found?
	* what were the problems?
	* did you solve them? yes, how? no, what barrier?
	* discuss/compare outcomes
* sum up at the end

**Possible Problems**
* WIFI is not working
* too many participants: build new groups. group people together up to 4 but not more.

#### On Screen Tutorials

This session shows hands-on stuff on the screen, and optionally let's everyone in the training follow step-by-step the things shown (e.g. explaining iPython notebook).

If you want to know more about coding stuff for workshops, look under Preparations -> Software.

**Purpose**


* show the audience some things / use-cases which can be done with Content-Mine. 
* Introduce the audience into the Content-Mine software
* offer some pre-coded functionality to make more sophisticated analysis and applications easier to do for the audience.

**Preparations**


* have in mind, that the beamer may has lower resolution
* Execute the tutorials in a sequential way
* plan breaks when blocks are done
* look for supporters: because one person is all the time presenting at the front, the resources are very low to do support for the participants and solve problems on their machine

**Timeline**

* explain the things you will do
	* ask people to help each other
	* check if the system is running
* start the presentation
* sum up at the end

**Didactics**

* take it easy and make intentional breaks to let users follow up.
* take yourself time to type and execute commands. be aware, that after executing the command, the command itself may disappear from the screen, so it is not visible anymore for the participants. When you want to use short-cuts like tab-completion, explain and show them.


**Possible Problems**


* people get stuck and fall away: prepare breaks, have someone to support and help
* the data gets changed

#### Discussions

A discussion is something familiar, so not too much must be said about it. This mostly focuses on offering some hints to moderate discussions and get them started.

**Purpose**


* let everyone speak
* offer a inclusive environment
* let people connect with each other

**Preparations**

* prepare a backup plan, if no one wants to start.
* prepare 2-3 questions, especially one to kick-start the discussion
	* try to identify in advance people who are likely to start

**Timeline**

* explain the goal of the discussion
* tell duration
* start discussion: make general question. if no one starts, ask a person directly
* moderate the comments. everyone should say something
+ stop discussion: when time is over, or ask participants if they want to overdue 5-15min (but not more!)

**Possible Problems**
* no one says something: wait, stay relaxed and offer a friendly and welcoming space. after 1min of waiting time (but before it gets too weird), ask again a person directly

#### World Cafe

**Concept**

A Worl Cafe is a discussive format to bringt people and ideas together in small, intimate groups of 3-5 people. The group discusses several topics proposed by the facilitators in a defined amount of time. Normally you do it 3 times with around 10-20 minutes for each round. The length mostly depends on the time you have, the number of rounds too, but also on what you want to achieve with your questions.

**Purpose**
* Connect with the people in a meaningful way
* Let people interact on a personal and direct level
* Create a social athmosphere
* Get straight into the thoughts and ideas of the people, no talking around issues!

**Application**
* After people did some content mining, more towards the end of a workshop
* useful to wrap up things and get a meta-perspective
* After theoretical, one-to-many block

**Preparation**
* Virtual bell: to stop the rounds
* post-its
* Pens and Sheets with questions on them
* Tixu/Pins to hang up the sheets after the World Cafe
* Think of 3-4 questions that open up a discussion, e.g. 
	* What are opportunities created through content mining?
	* What are barrier for content mining?
	* How can content mining help you?

**Timeline**
1. Explain the next session: 
	* “How knows what a world cafe is?“
	* Art of Hosting method
	* tell the number of rounds and length
	* tell about meta harvest if done at the end
	* tell the questions to discuss
	* document on sheets offered by facilitators
	* groups should get straight into the topics!
	* seperate into groups of 3-5 people
	* ask for help to re-structure the room if necessary
	* start the room setup: hand out pens and sheets
	* Sum up: get in your round, discuss and document things
2. Get in groups. 
3. Discuss and document first question
	* Ask if everyone has a sheet and 2-3 pens
4. Warn one minute before the end
5. Ring virtual bell after round ended
6. Group change: one person stays (decide yourself on the table who does what, if meta-harvest is used, the person who stays should report at the end in the big circle), everyone else should look for at total new group
7. Point 3 to 6 will be repeated until last question was discussed
8. Collect sheets and pin them on the wall
9. Circle (optional)
	* The Circle sits all people in a circle to start a meta-harvest of the world cafe rounds. 
	* In this the main topics of the groups get presented and discussed. 
	* From every group at least one person should speak about what happened and what where the main points. 
	* A new sheet should be prepared for this. 
	* This can take from 10 to 30 minutes and even more, if people have something to tell. 
	* if not enough time to allow everyone to speak, just ask one per table to present issues

**Possible Problems**
* not enough participants: just reduce the number of groups too the smallest number necessary to get 3-5 people together.
* too many participants: scale up group size until 6 persons. look for additional tables. have more sheets and pens prepared than you expect.

### Examples
**This will come later**

* offer some examples of slots in a workshop in general and for CM in specific. Which formats are available? 
* how do facilitators organize their activites during the training? notes, laptop docs??
* narrative: offer information how to create a strong and compelling narrative in your training. this is a very crucial point
* link to older training repos

## 4. Preparation

### Room
* Pin sheet with bit.ly shorturl to github repo on the main wall
* Pin sheet with most important steps for newbies on the wall
* Check if WIFI is available
* Beamer: check resolution
* check for plugs
* check for additional laptoops for users with none, or where the software does not work

### Software / VM
* if you work with data, check if it is okay to share it with the participants (privacy, copyright)
* think about different system requirements: OS, CPU power, inet bandwitdh, storage, RAM, pre-installed packages conflicts, 
* offer a sandbox (optional): for their first steps, before getting deeper into the software (e.g. creating a folder, opening a file, printing your first fact, etc.).
* document code well
* offer data examples (optional)
* offer code examples (optional)
* comment code so people understand processes
	* tell when computation may take a while
	* explain errors and how to handle them
	* give them information how to solve problems themselves
* prepare a data set, which can easily be reset after participants did some changes on it
* test your system: on different operating systems, on different hardware
	* when you test out your concept
	* when your software is finished

### Online
* GitHub repository
* wordpress event page [.md](LINK)
* Tweet about it

### Dissemniate
Share the content with the community, the hosts and associated people.

### Follow Up's
This is a very important point: What do you want the participants to follow up and take home with from the training? You should offer some (not more than 3!) concrete ways how to follow up after the training with the project or Content-Mining. It is also very important to get in touch with the most motivated people and look if they are interested in doing more around the topic and the project.

Here some examples:
* Make Pull Request with own hacks/code
* Communication: Email, Twitter, Mailinglist
* Discourse
* Invite to another training or related event
* Write direct email with specific topic

**Evaluation**
* work out [evaluation](LINNK)

### Create Training Materials
* think about color-blindness 

#### Slides
Some basic hints for creating and sharing slides

* try to not use lists, except it is obviously a list
* use big enough font size
* use colors which create high contrast to make it easier visible
* have in mind, that the beamer may has lower resolution
* use strong visual approach
* Slideshare is the prefered way to share your slides

#### Screencasts
Depending on your operating system, you can/should use:
* Ubuntu/Linux: RecordMyDesktop
* MacOS: 
* Windows: 

#### Hand Outs
* Add a bit.ly to the overall materials


#### GitHub repository
* offer participants ways to get to the necessary level in advance: install sw, learn stuff, read things

## 5. On Spot

* Check WIFI connection
* Disconnect interactive applications like Skype, Slack, Tweetdeck etc. so incoming messages don't disturbe the sessions.
* Open necessary folders, slides, applications, notes and rowser tabs
* mention follow ups, especially evaluation
* mention online materials, especially the github repository
* Don't pressure yourself and the participants: trainings must be easy going
* Ask if people are hold back by others things out of their control to implement things learned
* check for plugs

### Dealing with problems

* Offer advice for offline alternatives: Art of Hosting, always prepare something!
* Offer hints for testing the software, the data and the slides for readiness
* Social interaction: offer some basic methods and concrete examples for social interactions. Give hints for common problems (people not interested, people start to fight, people blame you for failing/weak training, etc.)
* Which information need to be available all the time, especially for new arriving people?
* Think through if way more or less people arrive: will the sessions still work? what could help, what do you have to change?
* How to treat racism, sexism, etc. Think about this when inviting people in advance and put focus on this 
* Work out alternative strategies for 3 and for 50 persons

## 6. Follow Up

Also look at Follow Up in Section "How to work out a Training" above.

**Participants**
* Send out Email with follow ups and evaluation form

**Hosts**
* get some feedback from them

**Online** 
* write blog post
* social media

**Facilitators**
* Document lessons learned in [doc.md](LINK).

## 7. Lessons Learned

This list describes common problems that may occur and how they can be solved.

| PROBLEMS | LESSONS LEARNED |
|----------|-----------------|
| The central message (vertical integration, ease of access and scalability, sectioning of papers, use of supplementary information) does not come across. | Put focus on unique points of interaction (sHTML, ctree, results) and not the technical details. |
| The use case demonstrated is not really appropriate for audience. | Start with powerful demo first, then go into technical details |
| Too much content in too less time, not enough time for teaching/delivering key message | Start low but have more in-depth stuff available. |
| Missing narrative, difficult transitions between sessions | Change preparation time allocation from 80% tech/ 20% storyline to 50/50. |
| Early technological problems (keyboard locales, VM on windows) lose large parts of the group, and it is difficult to recover from there. | Have backup plans and material: reserve more time for error handling and if something does not work. Define alternative tasks while solving problems. |
| Getting started with the VM could be problematic especially for newcomers. | People should not have to worry about CLI other than copying the relevant commands. Everything should have been within one folder which would be the starting folder of the command line. |
| Missing central documentation to direct people to. | Prepare a github repo and an etherpad. |
| Long URLs are difficult to type. | When uris are used, use bit.ly |
| People start wandering off on their own e.g. when some are still stuck at installing, and others already completed the task. | Define clearer “group stages” (Now we’re installing for 5 min; then we’ll begin with notebook; play around with facts for X min; then talk about results) |
| When a session loses focus, it is difficult to catch people's attention again and pull them back together. | Try to provide "a social solution for a technical problem" - clear statements what to do if something fails; have people group up in teams of two with different OS and experience level, so that they move more together. |
