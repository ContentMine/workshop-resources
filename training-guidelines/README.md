# Facilitator Materials

This directory contain resources to **organize**, **communicate**, **evaluate** and/or **facilitate a ContentMine training**. The following files are available to use:

* [General guidelines](general.md)
  What should the setting and atmosphere be like? What should your mindset as a facilitator be? The general guidelines offer ideas about giving a workshop. A 'lessons learned' section describes solutions to avoidable mistakes in planning or running a workshop.
* [Workflow](workflow.md)
  The workflow gives facilitators and organizers some orientation on which steps to perform when, and which dependencies exist. It also includes a checklist which helps facilitators and organizers prepare their sessions.
* [Evaluation & Assessment](evaluation-assessment.md)
  What to prepare for? What can be improved? This document describes how to identify the needs of your audience before the workshop and how to evaluate the workshop afterwards. Improving the materials and guidelines through github-issues or other feedback helps facilitators creating better workshops, and participants have a better experience.
* [Teaching resources](teaching.md)
  This contains a description of the methods used in the workshop as well as links to helpful external teaching resources.
