## What is a ctree?

A ContentTree, or short ctree, is the main datastructure of ContentMine.


A minimum ctree looks contains a `results.json`, which could be a result from [getpapers](../getpapers/getpapers-tutorial.md) or [quickscrape](../quickscrape/qickscrape-tutorial.md).


Output from [norma](../norma/norma-tutorial.md) or [ami](../ami/ami-tutorial.md) is added to this structure as well. A maximum ctree contains additional folders and files.
