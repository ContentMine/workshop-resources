## What is a CProject?

The central element in the pipeline is a paper, the format into which scientific knowledge currently is condensed. Therefore the data structure we use revolves around collections of papers, we call them CProject. Essentially a CProject is a naming convention for files and folders, no database or special tools are required to access it. 

## Why do we need it?

The conventions of a CProject on the one hand make it easy for third-party tools to connect to any part of the ContentMine pipeline, on the other hand it serves as an intermediary between the different tools and languages employed within the pipeline.
