Some online demos of content-mining - they may be dependent of servers being up.

## IUCN

We have created a filter of about 40,000 species from the IUCN redlist (many, but not all are "endangered"). These are run against the daily articles to populate a list of mentions of IUCN species. See http://iucn.contentmine.org
