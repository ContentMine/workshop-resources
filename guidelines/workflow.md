This should give facilitators and organizers some orientation on which steps to perform when. The *days ahead* estimations roughly indicate when this process should start, since there are dependencies later on.

The major points can be raised as personal issues for the facilitators/organizers, with the subpoints as issue notes. This helps keeping track of progress. Also, each major point should be discussed directly between facilitators/organizers at least once.

1. Set up repo via template [LINK]() (*21d ahead*)
	- fill in informations together with organizer
2. Think/talk about what people want to learn, we have three major use cases
	- send out pre-assessment (*21d ahead*)
3. choose modules according to audience, we have three module categories (*14d ahead*)
	- introduction
	- application of CMtools to do content mining
	- hacky, working together on user problems
4. draft session schedule (*14d ahead*)
  The session schedule should include short breaks after each session, possibly
	- think about: framing
	- discuss what should not / can not be done and why
	- potential technical issues -> prepare solution (additional documentation)
	- potential content questions / problems -> prepare answers
	- offer some social event in the evening
5. fill repo with anything necessary in advance (*14d ahead*)
	- downloads / installations / datasets / tech requirements
	- go through "before workshop" checklist
6. prepare materials (*10 ahead*)
	- slides -> upload
	- tech -> VM / USBs
	- handouts / posters / flipchart workshop sheets
	- online stuff -> pad, repo
	- personal notes
7. do workshop
	-  go through "during workshop" checklist
	- prepare locality (beamer, seating arrangement, material for harvesting)
8. review / evaluate (*1d later*)
	- update repo with content generated during workshop
	- send out follow ups, evaluation
