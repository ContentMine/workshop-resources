# Assessment and Evaluation

Finding out the needs of the participants (assessment) and how the workshop met them (evaluation) are two important steps for improving the quality of the content and experience for participants (and facilitators!). Allocate time and resources before and after any workshop to identify the needs of your audience and check how well they were met afterwards.

## Assessment

A survey like the following should be sent out in advance (a week or two) to registered participants so facilitators know who they are teaching. It also helps evaluating the workshop.

The assessment should answer questions like:

* Who is the audience?
* What do the visitors expect (reagarding the communicated knowledge about the session in advance)?
* What are the personal interests? 
* What do the hosts expect?
* What is the problem?
* Why does the workshop help to solve the problem?
* What is the prior knowledge about TDM, ContentMine, coding, etc?
* Newbie or Hands-On expert?


## Evaluation

For effective training and learning evaluation, the principal questions should be:

* To what extent were the identified training needs objectives achieved by the programme?
* To what extent were the learners' objectives achieved?
* What specifically did the learners learn or be usefully reminded of?
* What commitment have the learners made about the learning they are going to implement on their return to work?
