## Organisation

This directory contains resources for the organisation of a ContentMine workshop. The following files are available to use:

* [Workflow](workflow.md)
  The workflow gives facilitators and organizers some orientation on which steps to perform when, and which dependencies exist.
* [Checklist](checklist.md)
  The checklist helps facilitators and organizers prepare their sessions. They be converted into github issues and be used as a ToDo list throughout the planning, execution and evaluation of the workshop.
* [Teaching resources](teaching.md)
  This contains a description of the methods used in the workshop as well as links to helpful external teaching resources.
* `template_programme`
  - this can be edited to make a programme for the day with the ContentMine theme. There are Pages and MS Word versions for Apple/Office users
* `repository template` LINK-to-workshoptemplate
  - this can be copied and pasted as the new workshop repository. It will need to be filled with the relevant information for the specific workshop.
