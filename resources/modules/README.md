# Content of this folder

This folder contains learning modules which can be combined in any desired way by workshop facilitators.
Each module contains a description of learning goals, links to additional resources like slides or software tutorials, and a detailed description of steps.

Modules beginning with "A" contain a general introduction to content mining and the ContentMine project. They include an overview about legal and practical issues, as well as an introduction to core concepts of content mining.

Modules beginning with "B" contain practical examples and demonstrations of ContentMine tools, and are designed as more interactive sessions.

Modules beginning with "C" build on what has been learned in "B". They are designed as hacky, guided applications of ContentMine tools, and enable participants to explore and work on their own use cases with the help of our facilitators.
