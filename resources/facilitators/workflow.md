This should give some facilitators and organizers some orientation on which steps to perform when.


- Set up repo via template [LINK]
	- fill in informations together with organizer
- Think/talk about what people want to learn, we have three major use cases
	- send out pre-assessment
- choose modules according to audience, we have three module categories
	- introduction
	- application of CMtools to do content mining
	- hacky, working together on user problems
- draft session schedule
  The session schedule should include short breaks after each session, possibly
	- think about: framing
	- discuss what should not / can not be done and why
	- potential technical issues -> prepare solution (additional documentation)
	- potential content questions / problems -> prepare answers
	- offer some social event in the evening
- prepare materials
	- slides -> upload
	- tech -> VM / USBs
	- handouts / posters / flipchart workshop sheets
	- online stuff -> pad, repo
	- personal notes
- fill repo with anything necessary in advance
	- downloads / installations / datasets / tech requirements
	- go through "before workshop" checklist
- do workshop
	-  go through "during workshop" checklist
	- prepare locality (beamer, seating arrangement, material for harvesting)
- review / evaluate
	- update repo with content generated during workshop
	- send out follow ups, evaluation
