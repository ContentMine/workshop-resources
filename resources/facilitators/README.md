## Organisation

*This directory contains resources for the organisation of a ContentMine workshop. The following files are available to use:

* [Workflow](workflow.md)
  This should give some facilitators and organizers some orientation on which steps to perform when.
* [Checklist](checklist.md)
  This should help facilitators and organizers prepare their sessions. Can be converted into github issues and be used as a to do list throughout the planning and execution of the workshop.
* `template_programme`
  - this can be edited to make a programme for the day with the ContentMine theme. There are Pages and MS Word versions for Apple/Office users
* `repository template` LINK-to-workshoptemplate
  - this can be copied and pasted as the new workshop repository. It will need to be filled with the relevant information for the specific workshop.
